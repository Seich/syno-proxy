# Syno-Proxy

Syno-proxy is a quick authentication proxy for Synology diskstations. It automatically 
uses the provided username and password to authenticate api requests. This is particularly
useful to access the surveillance station API for things like camera snapshots and home status.

I wrote it to make it easier to interface with homebridge in such a way I can run automations
based on it's data (home status, motion detection, snapshots).
